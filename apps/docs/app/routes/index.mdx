# Remix Validated Form

A form library purpose-built for [remix](https://remix.run) to make validation easy.

- Client-side, field-by-field validation (e.g. validate on blur) and form-level validation
- Set default values for the entire form in one place
- Re-use validation on the server
- Show validation errors from the server even without JS
- Detect if the current form is submitting when there are multiple forms on the page
- Supports nested objects and arrays
- Validation library agnostic
